    <h2 class="head">Light chewy bagels that will fill your taste buds!</h2>

    <p>
        The bialy is not a sub-type of bagel, it’s a thing unto itself. Round with a depressed middle filled with cooked
        onions and sometimes poppy seeds, it is simply baked (bagels are boiled, then baked).
        This means its outside is matte, not shiny, and it doesn’t have that pull-away crust. Large puffy bubbles
        characterize the bialy’s innards.
        Though it can be slathered with butter or cream cheese (and topped with cured/smoked fish), purists prefer them
        straight up, preferably no more than five hours after being pulled from the oven.

    <p>
        A traditional bialy has a diameter of up to 15 centimetres (5.9 in) and is a chewy yeast roll similar to a
        bagel.
        Unlike a bagel, which is boiled before baking, a bialy is simply baked, and instead of a hole in the middle it
        has a depression.
        Before baking, this depression is filled with diced onions and other ingredients, possibly including garlic,
        poppy seeds, or bread crumbs.

    <h3 class="head">Ingredients</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>For the Dough:</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups of bread flour</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon instant yeast</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups of water, at room temperature</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>For the Filling:</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>1 table spoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 large yellow onion, diced</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon bread crumbs</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons poppy seeds</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sliced green onion</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h4 class="head">Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine bread flour, yeast, salt, and water for dough in a bowl. Stir with a wooden spoon and mix until a
            very wet, soft, and sticky dough forms. Cover and leave at room temperature for at least 12 hours.</li>
        <li>When ready to make the bialys, heat olive oil for filling in a skillet over medium heat. Add onion and salt
            and cook, stirring occasionally until onion softens, sweetens, and turns golden brown, about 10 minutes.
            Turn off the heat and add bread crumbs, 2 teaspoons poppy seeds, green onion, and cayenne pepper. Stir to
            combine and cool down until needed.</li>
        <li>Uncover dough; it should be bubbly. Scrape it away from the sides of the bowl with a spatula and transfer
            onto a floured work surface. Dust a little flour over top and gently press dough with your hands to flatten.
            Divide it into 8 equal portions and roll each into a ball, using a bit of flour as needed. Stretch each ball
            gently and tuck dough under the bottom; place on a baking sheet lined with generously floured parchment
            paper or a silicone liner (such as Silpat®). Dust the tops with flour and carefully cover with a dish towel;
            let proof until just about doubled in size, 45 to 60 minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Flour your fingers and pick up one dough ball. Press and pull on the center to form it into a ring shape;
            the center of the dough will be thin and the edges will be thicker. Make sure the centers are very thin but
            be careful not to tear them open. Repeat with remaining balls.</li>
        <li>Fill the center of each with no more than a rounded teaspoon of onion-poppy seed filling, then gently press
            the filling up the sides toward the outer rings. (You will have extra filling.) Spray bialys with some cold
            water and sprinkle poppy seeds over top.</li>
        <li>Bake in the center of the preheated oven until puffed and nicely browned, about 12 minutes. Transfer to a
            wire rack and cool for about 20 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
